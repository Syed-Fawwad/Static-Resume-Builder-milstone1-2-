# Static-Resume-Builder-milstone1-2-
The Static Interactive Resume Builder is a web app that allows users to create and display a professional resume. Initially, the project features a static layout with personal info, skills, education, work experience, and contact details. Future plans include adding dynamic elements using TypeScript for better interactivity and user control.
