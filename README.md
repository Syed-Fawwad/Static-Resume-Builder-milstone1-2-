## Overview
This project is a static interactive resume builder application designed using *HTML, **CSS, and **TypeScript*. The goal of this project is to create a visually appealing and interactive resume that can be easily customized and used by individuals to display their personal and professional information. 

### Features:

- *Responsive Design*: The design is fully responsive, ensuring it looks great on both desktop and mobile devices.
  
### Technologies Used:
- *HTML*: For the structure and content of the resume.
- *CSS*: For styling the resume and creating a responsive layout.
- *TypeScript*: For adding interactivity (e.g., showing/hiding sections of the resume).

1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Open the index.html file in your browser to view the static resume.
